# SQL Capstone Project: Airline & Bike Sharing Analysis

### Project Overview
This capstone project showcases my skills in SQL for data analysis and business intelligence. The project involves building highly optimized SQL queries to solve diverse analytical problems, ranging from operational performance in an airline to retail sales in a bike-sharing business. The core focus was on applying advanced SQL concepts to derive actionable business insights.

### Key Skills & Techniques
* **Advanced SQL:** Applied Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions (RANK(), DENSE_RANK()), and conditional aggregations (CASE statements).
* **Query Optimization:** Leveraged optimized joins and subqueries for high performance on large datasets.
* **Data Aggregation & Reporting:** Created clear, formatted reports for financial and operational data, providing a unified view of key metrics.

### Project Sections

#### 1. Airline Database Analysis
* **Situation:** The business lacked an optimized way to analyze operational and financial data from its large airline database.
* **Task:** Build and optimize queries to solve problems related to flight performance, financial reporting, and customer insights.
* **Result:** Delivered an optimized SQL solution that provided a clear view of operational performance (e.g., on-time departures), and revenue streams, enhancing data analysis capabilities.
* **Files:** `airline_schema.sql` (Database schema) and `airline_queries.sql` (Solution queries).

#### 2. Bike Sharing Data Analysis
* **Situation:** The business needed to understand usage patterns and product popularity from a large, raw bike-sharing dataset.
* **Task:** Use SQL to find key insights, such as popular products, seasonal trends, and usage by city.
* **Result:** Provided actionable business insights through well-formatted reports that helped identify high-performing products and understand customer behavior.
* **Files:** `bike_sharing_queries.sql` (Solution queries).
